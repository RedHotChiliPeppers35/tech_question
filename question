# User Management Screen - User Interface Specification

## Requirements

The user management screen is designed to allow administrators to manage users within the system. The screen should provide functionality for adding, editing, and deleting user accounts. The following requirements should be met:

1. Display a list of existing users with their basic information (e.g., username, email, role).
2. Provide options to add a new user, edit an existing user, and delete a user.
3. Validate user inputs to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
4. Support pagination or scrolling for handling a large number of users.
5. Enable sorting and filtering options to easily find and manage users.
6. Provide clear error messages and notifications for any user management operations.
7. Responsive design to ensure compatibility with different devices and screen sizes.

## User Interface Components

The user management screen will consist of the following UI components:

1. User List Table: A table displaying the list of users with columns for username, email, role, and actions (Edit and Delete buttons).
2. Pagination or Scrollbar: If there is a large number of users, provide navigation controls to view additional users.
3. Search Bar: Allow administrators to search for specific users based on username, email, or role.
4. Sortable Columns: Allow administrators to sort the user list based on columns such as username, email, or role.
5. Add User Button: A button to initiate the process of adding a new user.
6. Edit User Button: A button associated with each user row to edit the corresponding user's details.
7. Delete User Button: A button associated with each user row to delete the corresponding user from the system.
8. User Form: A form for adding/editing user details, including fields for username, email, password, and role.
9. Save User Button: A button to save the changes made to a user's details in the User Form.
10. Cancel Button: A button to cancel any changes made in the User Form and return to the user list view.

## Page Behavior

1. On page load, fetch the list of users from the backend and display them in the User List Table.
2. Provide options for sorting the user list based on username, email, or role by clicking on the column headers.
3. Allow administrators to search for users by entering search criteria in the Search Bar.
4. Clicking the Add User button should open the User Form to create a new user.
5. Clicking the Edit button associated with a user should populate the User Form with the user's existing details for editing.
6. In the User Form, perform validation on user inputs, such as ensuring valid email format and required fields are filled.
7. Display appropriate error messages or notifications if any errors occur during user management operations.
8. Clicking the Delete button associated with a user should prompt a confirmation dialog before deleting the user.
9. Provide pagination or scrolling functionality if the number of users exceeds the visible limit.
10. The Save User button in the User Form should save the changes made to a user's details and update the user list.
11. The Cancel button in the User Form should discard any changes and return to the user list view.

This specification document outlines the requirements, UI components, and expected behavior for the user management screen. It provides a clear understanding of how the user interface should be developed and how different components should interact with each other.
